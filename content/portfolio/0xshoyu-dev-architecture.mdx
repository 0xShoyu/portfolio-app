## The Strategic Crisis

A modern Product Engineer needs more than a static PDF resume; they need a tangible, production-grade artifact that proves their capability. However, most developers default to heavy CMS platforms (Contentful, Sanity) or bloated templates that introduce unnecessary monthly operational costs (SaaS bloat) and technical debt.

### The Solution:
**A fully sovereign, Git-backed MDX engine deployed on the edge.**

### The Result:
A 100/100 Lighthouse score, **$0 monthly operating cost**, and an authoring experience that allows me to write technical documentation in native Markdown while rendering interactive React components.

## 🏗 Architecture: The Git-Backed CMS

Instead of fetching data from a third-party API, I leveraged the Node.js file system (`fs`) to parse local `.mdx` files at build time using `gray-matter`.

<div className="my-8 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-card border border-border/50">
    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-foreground">1. Build-Time Parsing</h3>
    <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
      Next.js App Router fetches and compiles the MDX files during the build process, resulting in statically generated (SSG) pages that serve instantly via CDN.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="p-6 rounded-xl bg-card border border-border/50">
    <h3 className="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-foreground">2. Component Injection</h3>
    <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
      Using <code>next-mdx-remote/rsc</code>, I map standard Markdown elements to custom Tailwind-styled React Server Components, securing external links automatically.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## 🛠 Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Bleeding-Edge Styling: Tailwind v4 Native Cascades
Migrating to Tailwind v4 allowed me to discard the bloated `tailwind.config.ts`. I utilized the new `@theme` directive directly within native CSS to map design system variables. This Apple-inspired "Sky-Dark" theme relies heavily on glassmorphism and SVG noise filters to create a tactile UI.

```css
/* src/app/globals.css */
@theme {
  --color-background: #082f49; /* Sky 950 */
  --color-foreground: #f0f9ff;
  --color-primary: #38bdf8;    /* Sky 400 */
  --color-card: rgba(12, 74, 110, 0.5);
}
```

### 2. Interaction Design: The Radial Spotlight
To achieve a premium, physical feel without layout thrashing, I utilized Framer Motion's `useMotionTemplate` and `useMotionValue`. 

Instead of re-rendering the React tree on every mouse movement, the component tracks the cursor coordinates and updates a CSS radial gradient on a hardware-accelerated overlay.

```tsx
// GPU-Accelerated Hover State
<motion.div
  className="absolute -inset-px rounded-xl opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 z-10"
  style={{
    background: useMotionTemplate`
      radial-gradient(
        650px circle at ${mouseX}px ${mouseY}px,
        rgba(56, 189, 248, 0.1),
        transparent 80%
      )
    `,
  }}
/>
```

## Impact Analysis

By treating my portfolio as a **Product** rather than a weekend project, I demonstrated the exact transition from Figma aesthetic to performant code that I bring to enterprise teams.

| Metric | Traditional Headless CMS | 0xShoyu Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Cost** | $15 - $50+ | **$0 (Vercel Hobby)** |
| **Data Fetch Latency** | 100ms - 300ms | **0ms (Static Edge)** |
| **Authoring** | Web GUI | **Native VSCode (MDX)** |
| **Styling Engine** | Tailwind v3 | **Tailwind v4 (Native CSS)** |
